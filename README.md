# About Web Automation using TestNG Selenium project:
In this project I have automated the website:  https://dailyfinance.roadtocareer.net.
I have automated the following steps using TestNG,RestAssured,Selenium 

{1. Register a new user (e.g. yourvalidgmailuser+1@gmail.com). Assert the congratulations email is received.
2. Now click on the reset password link. Write 2 negative test case and assert. 
3. Now Input valid gmail account you have registered and click on send reset link button
4. Now retrieve password reset mail from your gmail and set new password
5. Now login with the new password to ensure login successful
6. Add random 2 items (1 for all fields, another for only mandatory fields) and assert 2 items are showing on the item list
7. Now go to user profile and update user gmail with a new gmail
8. Now logout and login with the updated gmail account. Assert that using new email login is successful and using previous email login is failed.
9. Now logout again and login with the admin account. Admin credential must be sent from the terminal securely.
10. Search by the updated gmail and Assert that updated user email is showing on admin dashboard.}

After the automation I have generated the allure report for this project.
